# report-generator
This is a custom report generator that I made using React and Node Js. It has the functionality to parse .csv file data and make the report of the summary of the data accordingly through a custom html template. Do give it a try! 

## Getting started 
Clone the repo: 

### `git clone https://github.com/mihir224/report-generator`

## To run the app locally

Install all necessary dependencies, in both client and server folders run:
### `npm install`

In the client side, run:
### `npm start`

 In the server side, run :
### `nodemon index.js`
